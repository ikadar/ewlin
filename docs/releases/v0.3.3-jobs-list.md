## Technical Notes

### Component Structure

```
LeftPanel/
├── JobsList/
│   ├── JobsList.tsx        # Main container with filter
│   ├── JobListItem.tsx     # Individual job row
│   ├── JobFilter.tsx       # Filter input component
│   └── index.ts
```

### Job Status Colors

Based on `JobStatus` enum:
- `Draft` - Gray
- `Planned` - Blue
- `InProgress` - Yellow/Amber
- `Delayed` - Red
- `Completed` - Green
- `Cancelled` - Gray (strikethrough)

### Late Job Detection

Jobs are considered late if they appear in `snapshot.lateJobs` array. Display a warning icon next to the deadline indicator.

### Keyboard Navigation

- `ArrowUp` - Select previous job
- `ArrowDown` - Select next job
- Focus should remain in the list when navigating

### Filter Logic

Filter jobs where:
- `job.reference` contains filter text (case-insensitive)
- OR `job.client` contains filter text
- OR `job.description` contains filter text
