# Release v0.3.14 – Drop Handling

> **Status:** 🔴 Not Started

## Overview

This release implements the drop handling logic for drag and drop operations. When a tile is dropped on a valid position, the system creates a new assignment with optimistic UI update. Invalid drops show conflicts in the Problèmes section. Tile insertion follows the push-down behavior for capacity-1 stations.

---

## Prerequisites

- [x] v0.3.13 - Real-Time Validation During Drag released
- [x] useDropValidation hook available
- [x] Mock snapshot with updateSnapshot function

---

## Scope

### In Scope

- **Create assignment on valid drop** - Generate TaskAssignment on successful drop
- **Optimistic UI update** - Immediately show tile at dropped position
- **Conflict display** - Show conflicts in Problèmes section (warnings only)
- **Tile insertion (push-down)** - For capacity-1 stations, push subsequent tiles down
- **End time calculation** - Calculate scheduledEnd based on task duration

### Out of Scope

- Server-side validation (mock only)
- Tile overlap for capacity > 1 stations (simplified: all stations treated as capacity-1)
- Undo functionality
- Drag from left panel (existing tiles only)

## Technical Notes

### Assignment Creation

```typescript
// Create new TaskAssignment
const newAssignment: TaskAssignment = {
  id: generateId(), // UUID
  taskId: task.id,
  targetId: stationId,
  isOutsourced: false,
  scheduledStart: scheduledStart,
  scheduledEnd: calculateEndTime(task, scheduledStart),
  isCompleted: false,
  completedAt: null,
  createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),
  updatedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
};
```

### End Time Calculation

For internal tasks:
- `scheduledEnd = scheduledStart + (task.estimatedMinutes * 60 * 1000)`
- Simple calculation without operating hours stretching (MVP)

### Push-Down Logic

When inserting a tile that would overlap with existing tiles:
1. Find all assignments on the same station that start at or after the new tile's start
2. Calculate the duration of the new tile
3. Shift all subsequent tiles by the new tile's duration
4. Update assignments in snapshot

### Optimistic Update

Use `updateSnapshot()` from mock/snapshot.ts:
```typescript
updateSnapshot((snapshot) => ({
  ...snapshot,
  assignments: [...snapshot.assignments, newAssignment],
}));
```

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests

- [ ] Assignment creation with correct fields
- [ ] End time calculation is accurate
- [ ] Push-down logic shifts subsequent tiles correctly
- [ ] Conflict is added when bypass is used
- [ ] Snapshot version increments on update

### Integration Tests

- [ ] Drop creates visible tile at correct position
- [ ] Push-down animates affected tiles
- [ ] Conflicts appear in Problèmes section

### Manual Testing

- [ ] Drop tile on empty slot - tile appears
- [ ] Drop tile on occupied slot - pushes down existing tiles
- [ ] Drop with Alt (bypass) - tile appears with conflict badge
- [ ] Multiple drops work correctly
- [ ] Tile appears at snapped position
