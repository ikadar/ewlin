## Technical Notes

### Scroll Implementation

The grid scroll uses the SchedulingGrid component. To scroll to a specific time:

```typescript
// Calculate Y position from time
const PIXELS_PER_HOUR = 120; // From TimelineColumn
const START_HOUR = 6;

function timeToYPosition(time: Date): number {
  const hours = time.getHours() + time.getMinutes() / 60;
  return (hours - START_HOUR) * PIXELS_PER_HOUR;
}
```

### Job Navigation Logic

Navigate through the filtered/sorted job list:
- Use the same order as displayed in JobsList
- Wrap around at boundaries (last → first, first → last)
- If no job is selected, select the first one

### Date Calculations

For Page Up/Down, scroll by one full day (24 * PIXELS_PER_HOUR = 2880px).

For ALT+D (jump to departure date):
- Get selected job's `workshopExitDate`
- Position the date at the **bottom** of the viewport (backward scheduling workflow)
