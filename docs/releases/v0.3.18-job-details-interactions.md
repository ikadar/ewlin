## Overview

Enhanced task interactions in the Job Details Panel. Users can double-click a task to recall it from the schedule, or single-click to jump to its position on the grid. These interactions improve the scheduling workflow by providing quick access to scheduled tasks.

---

## Prerequisites

- [x] v0.3.17 - Keyboard Shortcuts released
- [x] Job Details Panel with task list
- [x] Task recall functionality (existing implementation recalls from grid)
- [x] Grid scroll capability

---

## Scope

### In Scope

- **R1: Double-click recall** - Double-click on a scheduled task in the Job Details Panel to unschedule it (remove from grid)
- **R2: Single-click jump** - Single-click on a scheduled task in the Job Details Panel to scroll the grid to that tile's position

### Out of Scope

- Right-click context menus (post-MVP)
- Drag-and-drop from Job Details Panel (separate feature)
- Multi-select recall (post-MVP)

## Technical Notes

### Double-click Recall (R1)

When a scheduled task is double-clicked in the Job Details Panel:
1. Find the assignment for that task
2. Remove the assignment from the snapshot
3. Task returns to "unscheduled" state in the UI

```typescript
// In TaskRow component
const handleDoubleClick = () => {
  if (!isScheduled) return;

  const assignment = assignments.find(a => a.taskId === task.id);
  if (assignment) {
    onRecallTask(assignment.id);
  }
};
```

### Single-click Jump (R2)

When a scheduled task is single-clicked:
1. Find the assignment for that task
2. Calculate the grid position from `scheduledStart`
3. Scroll the grid to center that position
4. Optionally highlight/flash the tile

```typescript
// In TaskRow component
const handleClick = () => {
  if (!isScheduled) return;

  const assignment = assignments.find(a => a.taskId === task.id);
  if (assignment) {
    onJumpToTask(assignment);
  }
};
```

### Visual Feedback

- Scheduled tasks in Job Details Panel should have a distinct style (e.g., checkmark icon, different color)
- Cursor should indicate clickability (`cursor: pointer`)
- Consider hover state showing "Click to jump" or "Double-click to recall" tooltip
