# Release v0.3.25 – Grid Tile Repositioning

> **Status:** ✅ Released
>
> **Milestone:** M3 (Frontend Integration)
>
> **Release Date:** 2025-12-18
>
> **Git Tag:** `v0.3.25`

## Overview

Enable drag-and-drop repositioning of scheduled tiles on the grid. Users can drag a tile up or down within its station column to change the scheduled time. The tile stays on the same station — only the time changes.

---

## Prerequisites

- [x] v0.3.20 - Tile-Based Drop Position (grab offset calculation)
- [x] Drag-drop infrastructure (v0.3.11)
- [x] Drop handling with push-down (v0.3.14)
- [x] Real-time validation during drag (v0.3.13)

---

## Scope

### In Scope

- **Drag scheduled tiles** within the same station column
- **Reschedule** to new time position on drop
- **Push-down behavior** when dropping onto/between other tiles
- **Precedence validation** during drag (real-time feedback)
- **Alt-key bypass** for precedence (same as new placements)

### Out of Scope

- Cross-station drag (changing station) — task is bound to station
- Multi-tile drag (select and move multiple)
- Drag to left panel (use recall instead)

## Technical Notes

### Drag Behavior

1. **Drag start:** User grabs a scheduled tile on the grid
2. **During drag:**
   - Tile follows cursor (with grab offset from v0.3.20)
   - Original position shows ghost/placeholder
   - Real-time validation shows valid/invalid drop zones
   - Other tiles on same station are non-interactive (pointer-events: none)
3. **Drop:**
   - Calculate new `scheduledStart` from drop position
   - Apply push-down if overlapping with other tiles
   - Update assignment via API

### Constraints

| Constraint | Behavior |
|------------|----------|
| Same station only | Tile cannot leave its column |
| Precedence | Auto-snap to valid position (or Alt bypass) |
| No past scheduling | Cannot drop before current time |
| 30-min snap | Snaps to nearest 30-minute boundary |

### Visual Feedback During Drag

```
Original position:        During drag:
┌─────────┐               ┌ ─ ─ ─ ─ ┐  ← Ghost (dashed outline)
│  Tile   │               │  ghost  │
└─────────┘               └ ─ ─ ─ ─ ┘

                          ┌─────────┐  ← Dragged tile at cursor
                          │  Tile   │
                          └─────────┘
```

### API Integration

On drop, call reschedule mutation:

```typescript
// Mutation to update assignment
rescheduleAssignment({
  assignmentId: assignment.id,
  newScheduledStart: calculatedDropTime,
});
```

Backend recalculates `scheduledEnd` using EndTimeCalculator.

## Feature Checklist

### Tile Component

- [x] **Make scheduled tiles draggable**
  - Description: Enable drag on tiles rendered in grid
  - Files: `apps/web/src/components/Tile/Tile.tsx`

- [x] **Drag start handler**
  - Description: Record grab offset, set drag data
  - Files: `apps/web/src/components/Tile/Tile.tsx`, `apps/web/src/App.tsx`

- [x] **Ghost placeholder**
  - Description: Show dashed outline at original position during drag
  - Files: `apps/web/src/components/Tile/Tile.tsx`

### Station Column

- [x] **Accept drops from grid tiles**
  - Description: Handle drop of existing tiles (not just from sidebar)
  - Files: `apps/web/src/App.tsx` (existing drop zone works)

- [x] **Distinguish reschedule vs new placement**
  - Description: Detect if dropped tile is existing assignment or new
  - Files: `apps/web/src/App.tsx`

### Drop Handling

- [x] **Reschedule on drop**
  - Description: Update scheduledStart for existing assignment
  - Files: `apps/web/src/App.tsx`

- [x] **Push-down integration**
  - Description: Apply push-down logic for repositioned tiles
  - Files: `apps/web/src/App.tsx` (reuses existing pushDown logic)

### Validation

- [x] **Real-time precedence check during drag**
  - Description: Show valid/invalid zones while dragging
  - Files: Reuses existing validation infrastructure

---

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests

- [x] Drag data includes assignment ID for existing tiles
- [x] Drop handler distinguishes new vs reschedule
- [x] Push-down works for repositioned tiles
- [x] Grab offset is applied correctly

### E2E Tests

Location: `apps/web/cypress/e2e/grid-tile-repositioning.cy.ts`

- [x] Can drag scheduled tile up/down within column
- [x] Tile snaps to 30-minute boundaries on drop
- [x] Ghost placeholder visible during drag
- [x] Push-down works when dropping onto other tiles
- [x] Tile position updates after drop
- [x] Cannot drag tile outside its station column

### Manual Testing

- [x] Can drag scheduled tile up/down within column
- [x] Tile snaps to 30-minute boundaries
- [x] Ghost shows at original position during drag
- [x] Push-down works when dropping onto other tiles
- [x] Precedence validation shows during drag
- [x] Alt-key bypasses precedence safeguard
- [x] Cannot drag tile to another column
- [x] Cannot drag tile to past time
