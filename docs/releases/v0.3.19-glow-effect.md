## Overview

Replace the current ring-based selection indicator on tiles with a glow effect. When a job is selected, all tiles belonging to that job display a subtle glow instead of a ring border, providing better visual feedback without obscuring tile content.

## Prerequisites

- [x] v0.3.18 - Job Details Task Interactions released
- [x] Tile component with selection state
- [x] Job selection functionality

---

## Scope

### In Scope

- **R3: Glow effect** - Replace ring indicator with CSS box-shadow glow for selected tiles
- Color-matched glow (uses job color or contrasting highlight)
- Consistent appearance across all tile states (setup, run sections)

### Out of Scope

- Animated/pulsing glow (post-MVP if desired)
- Customizable glow intensity (post-MVP)
- Different glow colors per selection type

## Technical Notes

### Current Implementation (Ring)

```typescript
// Current: ring border
className={cn(
  'tile',
  isSelected && 'ring-2 ring-blue-500'
)}
```

### Proposed Implementation (Glow)

```typescript
// Proposed: glow effect using box-shadow
className={cn(
  'tile',
  isSelected && 'shadow-glow'
)}

// In Tailwind config or custom CSS:
.shadow-glow {
  box-shadow: 0 0 12px 4px rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.6); // blue-500 with opacity
}
```

### Glow Properties

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Blur radius | 12px |
| Spread | 4px |
| Color | Job color or blue-500 at 60% opacity |
| Animation | None (static) |

### Alternative: Job Color Glow

For better visual association, the glow could use the job's assigned color:

```typescript
style={{
  boxShadow: isSelected
    ? `0 0 12px 4px ${hexToRgba(job.color, 0.6)}`
    : 'none'
}}
```
